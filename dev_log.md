- Added proper logging for debugging block processing
- Component is now ready to render when Sanity provides `renewableEnergyForecast` blocks

NOTE: Frontend will now recognize and render the renewable energy forecast chart when it receives blocks of type `renewableEnergyForecast` from Sanity CMS

## [2024-12-28] – Energy Forecast API Route Creation
Goal: Create missing API route to resolve 404 error for renewable energy forecast data

- Created `api/energy-forecast.ts` API route for fetching renewable energy forecast data
- Integrates with EnergiDataService.dk "Forecasts_Hour" dataset
- Supports date range queries with start/end parameters
- Handles region filtering for DK1 (Vestdanmark) and DK2 (Østdanmark) 
- Includes proper error handling and status codes
- Uses Vercel serverless function format for deployment
- Resolves 404 error that was preventing RenewableEnergyForecast component from loading data

## API Endpoint Features
- **Date Range Support**: Queries forecast data for selected date + next day
- **Region Filtering**: Supports DK1 and DK2 price areas
- **Sorted Results**: Returns data sorted by HourUTC ascending
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages
- **EnergiDataService Integration**: Uses official Danish energy data API

NOTE: The renewable energy forecast chart should now load data successfully without 404 errors

## [2024-12-28] – Renewable Energy Chart Visual Bug Fixes
Goal: Fix visual bugs in the stacked area chart for proper rendering of zero-value categories

- Fixed `processedData` useMemo hook to ensure all 24 hours are present in the dataset
- Added full 24-hour array generation (`00:00` to `23:00`) for complete time coverage
- Improved data processing to handle missing hours from API response
- Added `stackId="1"` to all Area components to ensure proper stacking behavior
- Ensures zero-value categories are properly displayed in the stacked areas
- Fixed issue where Recharts might optimize away zero-value areas
- Enhanced robustness against incomplete API data responses

## Bug Fixes Applied
- **Complete Hour Coverage**: Generates full 24-hour dataset even if API returns incomplete data
- **Proper Stacking**: Added stackId to ensure all Area components stack correctly
- **Zero-Value Handling**: Ensures zero-value energy sources are still visible in the chart
- **Data Consistency**: Guarantees consistent chart rendering regardless of API data gaps
- **Visual Continuity**: Maintains proper color stacking and area rendering

NOTE: The renewable energy forecast chart should now properly display all energy categories with correct stacking behavior

## [2024-12-28] – RenewableEnergyForecast Data Processing Logic Fixes  
Goal: Fix data processing logic to correctly parse API data and render the chart with proper scaling

- **Replaced processedData useMemo hook**: Simplified and corrected the data grouping logic
  - Removed complex 24-hour array generation that was causing issues
  - Implemented direct hour-based grouping using `toLocaleTimeString` with both hour and minute
  - Fixed hour key formatting to use proper `HH:mm` format with colon replacement
  - Added proper null/empty data checks at the beginning of the function
  - Simplified return mapping using object destructuring for cleaner code

- **Enhanced Y-Axis scaling**: Added `domain={[0, 'dataMax + 100']}` prop to YAxis component
  - Prevents "flatline" effect when values are very low but not zero
  - Ensures Y-axis scales nicely from 0 to slightly above the highest data value
  - Improves chart readability by providing proper visual scale

## Technical Improvements
- **Simplified Logic**: More direct and reliable data processing approach  
- **Better Hour Handling**: Proper time formatting using Danish locale settings
- **Robust Grouping**: For-loop based iteration with proper type safety
- **Enhanced Scaling**: Dynamic Y-axis domain prevents visual scaling issues
- **Improved Reliability**: Better handling of edge cases and empty data scenarios

NOTE: The chart should now correctly parse API data and render with proper visual scaling, resolving any rendering issues with the renewable energy forecast display

## [2024-12-28] – Area Chart Stacking Order Fix
Goal: Fix visual stacking order in RenewableEnergyForecast to ensure all energy types are properly visible

- **Fixed Area Component Order**: Reversed the order of the three `<Area>` components in the AreaChart
  - **New Order**: OffshoreWind → OnshoreWind → Solar (was Solar → OnshoreWind → OffshoreWind)
  - **Reasoning**: In stacked area charts, components rendered later appear on top, potentially hiding earlier ones
  - **Visual Impact**: All three energy types (Solar, Onshore Wind, Offshore Wind) are now properly visible
  - **Color Layering**: Ensures proper color composition reflects true renewable energy forecast data

## Technical Implementation
- **Stacking Logic**: Recharts renders Area components in the order they appear in JSX
- **Visibility Fix**: By placing wind components first and Solar last, all layers are now visible
- **Data Integrity**: Chart now accurately represents the composition of renewable energy sources
- **User Experience**: Users can clearly see the contribution of each energy type at any given hour

NOTE: The renewable energy forecast chart now displays all three energy categories with proper visual stacking, ensuring complete data visibility and accurate representation of the energy mix
