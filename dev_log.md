# Dev Log

## 2025-08-08 – Update
Goal: Fix Forbrug Tracker component not rendering (error fallback shown)

- Issue: The component read search params via `useSearchParams` which caused SSR/client mismatch and triggered the ContentBlocks error boundary (“Dette indhold kunne ikke vises”).
- Action: In `src/components/forbrugTracker/ForbrugTracker.tsx`, replaced `useSearchParams` with a client-only `window.location.search` read guarded by `typeof window !== 'undefined'` to avoid SSR usage.
- Impact: Forbrug Tracker renders reliably on initial load; avoids error boundary in SSR.
- TO VERIFY: Navigate to `/forbrug-tracker` and confirm component mounts and shows connect flow; check console for any API errors.

## 2025-08-08 – Update
Goal: Fix Eloverblik third-party flow for Forbrug Tracker (metering points + date handling)
## 2025-08-08 – Update
Goal: Reduce 429s on third-party consumption calls and improve UX

- Backend `api/eloverblik.ts`:
  - Added short-term cache (2 min) for identical consumption queries (keyed by identifier/date/MPs).
  - Implemented retry with exponential backoff (1s, 2s) for 429/503 per API recommendations.
  - Returns `suggestedRetrySeconds` on 429/503 to guide client messaging.
- Frontend `ForbrugTracker.tsx`:
  - Prevent duplicate in-flight requests; show clear 429/503 message instructing to wait.
- Impact: Fewer immediate 429s after refresh; clearer user feedback when upstream is rate-limiting.
- TO VERIFY: Rapidly refresh `/forbrug-tracker` and ensure second request within 2 minutes returns cached response or shows friendly 429 note instead of crashing fallback.

- Backend `api/eloverblik.ts`:
  - Added cached third-party access token helper to reduce 429s.
  - Implemented `isGuidLike` scope detection and correct mapping: prefer `authorizationId`, fallback to `customerCVR`.
  - Added `clampDateRange` to prevent future `dateTo` (avoids error 30003).
  - Cached metering points by `authorizationId` (15 min TTL) and added CVR fallback if needed.
  - Improved error responses with scope/identifier context. Included `totalConsumption` in successful payloads.
- Frontend `src/components/forbrugTracker/ForbrugTracker.tsx`:
  - Now passes `authorizationId`, `customerCVR`, and cached `meteringPointIds` explicitly to consumption request (removed string heuristics).
  - Refresh button uses explicit identifiers as well.
- Impact: Prevents 404 “No metering points found” due to wrong scope/identifier, avoids future-date rejections, and reduces rate-limiting via caching.
- TO VERIFY: After completing MitID flow, `thirdparty-authorizations` returns authorizations with `meteringPointIds`, and `thirdparty-consumption` returns non-empty `result` for last 30 days with `aggregation=Day`.

## 2025-08-08 – Update
Goal: ProviderList fails to render due to invalid Sanity references

- Hardened `src/components/ProviderList.tsx` to sanitize `block.providers`:
  - Filter out null/undefined providers and those with `isActive === false`.
  - Ensure each provider has a stable `id` by falling back to `_id` or a derived key.
- Impact: Prevents the component error boundary from tripping with “Dette indhold kunne ikke vises” when a page contains empty or inactive provider references. List now renders consistently if at least one valid provider is present.
- TO VERIFY: Studio `providerList.providers[]` contains active references; run `node scripts/testPageQuery.js` to confirm provider fields present in GROQ response.

## 2025-08-08 – Update
Goal: Fix empty-looking select fields in desktop comparison table

- Adjusted desktop select trigger styles in `src/components/RealPriceComparisonTable.tsx` to ensure placeholder and text are visible on light theme (`text-brand-dark` and `placeholder:text-gray-600`).
- Impact: Prevents an apparent "empty white bar" on desktop by making the select content clearly visible when no provider is chosen. Mobile cards were already fine.
- TODO: Consider auto-selecting first two providers after fetch to reduce empty state friction.

## 2025-08-07 – Update
Goal: Align FE schemas with Studio and elevate PageSection visuals

- Implemented runtime Zod validation for UnifiedPage and contentBlocks to filter invalid blocks and log schema mismatches.
- Synced frontend Zod/TS types with Studio: faqGroup (uses faqItems), heroWithCalculator.highlightWords, extended fields for consumptionMap, declarationProduction, declarationGridmix, providerList, energyTipsSection defaultCategory.
- Updated FAQ extraction to support both faqItems and legacy items in `Index.tsx` and `GenericPage.tsx`.
- Upgraded `PageSectionComponent` visuals (enterprise polish): heading accent underline, subtle theme-aware background depth overlay, premium image treatment, pill CTA, fullWidth support, and preserved all Sanity-driven settings (theme, padding, text alignment, separator, sticky, layout).

- Impact: More resilient runtime rendering (invalid blocks no longer break pages), FE <-> Studio schema drift reduced, and improved perceived quality for the most common content section without requiring Studio changes.

- NOTE: `npm run lint` currently hits an upstream plugin issue in `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` on `src/utils/inpOptimization.ts`. Type-check is green. Proceeding with push to allow visual review.

- TO VERIFY:
  - Pages with `faqGroup` render FAQs and SEO structured data as expected.
  - Visual polish in `PageSectionComponent` matches brand expectations across themes.
  - Optional: decide whether to add Studio toggles for enabling/disabling visual flourishes.
