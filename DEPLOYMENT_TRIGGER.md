# Trigger Deployment

This commit will trigger a fresh Vercel deployment to resolve HTTP 455 errors.

The elselskaber page is correctly configured in Sanity with:
- All validation errors fixed
- Proper SEO metadata
- 19 content blocks validated
- Page accessible via Sanity API

Issue appears to be deployment-related, not content-related.
