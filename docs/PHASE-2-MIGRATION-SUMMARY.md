# Phase 2 Migration Summary - Data Migration Complete

## Overview
Phase 2 of the homepage unification migration has been successfully completed. The homepage content "DinElPortal - Danmarks førende elprissider" has been migrated from the `homePage` schema to the unified `page` schema.

## What Was Done

### 1. Schema Updates ✅
- Added `_migratedFrom` field to page schema for rollback tracking
- Deployed changes to Sanity Studio

### 2. Migration Scripts Created ✅
- **migrate-homepage-to-unified.ts**: Migrates homepage data
- **verify-homepage-migration.ts**: Verifies migration integrity  
- **rollback-homepage-migration.ts**: Emergency rollback script

### 3. Data Migration Executed ✅
Successfully migrated homepage with the following results:
- **Original**: `homePage` type, ID: `084518ec-2f79-48e0-b23c-add29ee83e6d`
- **Migrated**: `page` type, ID: `page.homepage.1754076086863`
- **Status**: 
  - ✅ All 17 content blocks preserved
  - ✅ SEO metadata intact
  - ✅ isHomepage flag set to true
  - ✅ No slug (correct for homepage)
  - ✅ Migration tracking via _migratedFrom field

### 4. Verification Complete ✅
All verification tests passed:
- Legacy homepage preserved for rollback
- Unified homepage created with correct settings
- Migration tracking in place
- Frontend compatibility maintained
- Content integrity verified (17 blocks match)

### 5. Frontend Compatibility Tested ✅
- Legacy queries continue to work
- New unified queries return migrated homepage
- Dual-schema queries prioritize new schema
- No breaking changes - frontend continues to function

## Current State

### In Sanity:
1. **Legacy Homepage** (KEPT):
   - Type: `homePage`
   - Title: "DinElPortal - Danmarks førende elprissider"
   - Status: Preserved for rollback

2. **New Homepage** (ACTIVE):
   - Type: `page`
   - Title: "DinElPortal - Danmarks førende elprissider"
   - isHomepage: `true`
   - All content migrated successfully

### Frontend Behavior:
- Currently uses legacy `getHomePage()` method
- Will automatically use new homepage when updated in Phase 3
- Complete backward compatibility maintained

## Rollback Procedure (If Needed)

If issues arise, rollback is simple:
```bash
cd /Users/kaancatalkaya/Desktop/projects/sanityelpriscms
CONFIRM_ROLLBACK=true npx tsx scripts/rollback-homepage-migration.ts
```

This will:
1. Delete the migrated page
2. Revert to using the legacy homepage
3. Frontend continues working via fallback

## Next Steps - Phase 3

Phase 3 will update the frontend to use the unified schema:
1. Update `Index.tsx` to use `getUnifiedHomePage()`
2. Create unified content block wrapper
3. Update routing logic to use `isHomepage` flag
4. Remove dependency on `homePage` type checks

## Key Achievements

- ✅ Zero downtime migration
- ✅ Complete data preservation
- ✅ Rollback capability maintained
- ✅ Frontend continues working unchanged
- ✅ Type safety preserved throughout
- ✅ All content and SEO data intact
