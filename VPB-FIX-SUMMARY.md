# Value Proposition Box Universal Fix - Summary

## ✅ Problem Solved

The Value Proposition Box (VPB) issue has been successfully resolved across all pages. 

### Root Cause
The VPB schema evolved over time with field name changes:
- `title` → `heading`
- `items` → `valueItems`
- `propositions` → `valueItems`

Content was stored in deprecated fields (`items`) but Sanity Studio only displayed new fields (`valueItems`), making the content appear empty in the editor while still showing on the frontend.

### Solution Implemented

1. **Analyzed the Issue**: Created diagnostic scripts to identify that data was in deprecated fields
2. **Migration Script**: Built and executed a comprehensive migration to move all data from deprecated to current fields
3. **Cleanup**: Removed deprecated fields after successful migration
4. **Verification**: Confirmed all VPBs now have data in the correct fields

### Results

#### Before Migration
- leverandoer-sammenligning: ⚠️ Data in deprecated field (`items`)
- elpriser: ⚠️ Data in deprecated field (`items`)
- historiske-priser: ⚠️ Data in deprecated field (`items`)
- prognoser: ⚠️ Data in deprecated field (`items`)
- Most pages showing empty VPBs in Sanity Studio

#### After Migration
- leverandoer-sammenligning: ✅ Data in correct field (`valueItems`)
- elpriser: ✅ Data in correct field (`valueItems`)
- historiske-priser: ✅ Data in correct field (`valueItems`)
- prognoser: ✅ Data in correct field (`valueItems`)
- All VPBs now editable in Sanity Studio

### Scripts Created

1. **diagnose-vpb-issue.ts** - Diagnostic tool to analyze VPB data location
2. **migrate-vpb-fields.ts** - Migration script to move data from deprecated to current fields
3. **cleanup-vpb-deprecated-fields.ts** - Cleanup script to remove old fields after migration

### Verification

The leverandoer-sammenligning page VPB now shows:
- **Heading**: "Fordele ved at sammenligne elselskaber"
- **Value Items**: 4 items with proper content
- **Sanity Studio**: ✅ Fully editable
- **Frontend**: ✅ Displays correctly

## Next Steps

The GROQ queries currently fetch both new and deprecated fields for backward compatibility. Once we're confident all pages are working correctly, we can:

1. Remove deprecated field fetching from GROQ queries
2. Remove backward compatibility code from the frontend component
3. This will simplify the codebase and improve performance

The Value Proposition Box issue is now completely resolved across all pages!
