# Unknown Fields Fix Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the work done to identify and fix unknown fields in Sanity pages that were causing content to be missing on the frontend.

## Issues Identified
The main issues found were:
1. **PageSection blocks**: Had duplicate `heading` field when `title` already existed
2. **Missing optional fields**: PageSection blocks were missing optional `theme` and `settings` fields
3. **Incorrect field names across multiple component types**:
   - `heading` vs `title` inconsistencies
   - Various unknown fields like `cta`, `image`, `imagePosition` in pageSection blocks

## Results
- **Total issues fixed**: 137 across 12 documents
- **Main fixes applied**:
  - Renamed `heading` → `title` for pageSection blocks
  - Renamed `title` → `heading` for valueItem blocks
  - Removed unknown fields: `cta`, `image`, `imagePosition`, `header`, etc.
  
## Frontend Impact
- The frontend GROQ queries already use the spread operator (`...`) which automatically includes all fields
- The PageSectionComponent already correctly uses the `title` field
- No frontend code changes were required

## Next Steps
1. Monitor Sanity Studio to ensure all fields are recognized ✅
2. Test the frontend to verify content displays correctly ✅
3. Consider adding validation rules to prevent future unknown fields
