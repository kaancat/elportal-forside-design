### Query Behavior
- Dual-schema queries return the new `page` type homepage
- Legacy queries continue to work for backward compatibility
- Frontend currently uses legacy queries (no breaking changes)

### Navigation Status
- **✅ No references to `homePage` type found in navigation**
- Mega menus: Clean
- Header links: Clean
- Footer links: Clean
- No navigation updates needed for Phase 4

### Frontend Status
- Current frontend continues working unchanged
- Uses legacy `getHomePage()` method
- Will automatically use new homepage when updated in Phase 3
- Complete backward compatibility maintained

## Risk Assessment

### Completed Without Issues ✅
- Schema changes deployed successfully
- Type safety fully implemented
- Data migration completed with integrity
- No breaking changes to production
- Rollback capability preserved

### Current Risks
- **None identified** - System is stable

### Mitigation Measures in Place
- Original homepage document preserved
- Rollback script ready if needed
- Dual-schema queries provide fallback
- Frontend has automatic compatibility

## Verification Results

### Automated Tests
All verification scripts pass:
- `test-unified-types-simple.ts` ✅
- `test-frontend-queries.ts` ✅
- `verify-homepage-migration.ts` ✅
- `comprehensive-migration-check.ts` ✅
- `check-navigation-references.ts` ✅

### Manual Verification
- Sanity Studio shows migrated homepage
- Content renders correctly
- No console errors
- Performance unchanged

## Next Steps: Phase 3

### Planned Tasks
1. Update `Index.tsx` to use `getUnifiedHomePage()`
2. Create unified content block wrapper component
3. Update routing logic to use `isHomepage` flag
4. Remove dependency on `homePage` type checks

### Expected Outcome
- Frontend will use new unified schema
- Continued backward compatibility
- Preparation for Phase 4 (script updates)

## Conclusion

The homepage unification migration is proceeding **perfectly according to plan**. All three completed phases (1, 1.5, and 2) have been implemented successfully with:

- ✅ Zero production issues
- ✅ Complete data integrity
- ✅ Full type safety
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility
