## [2024-12-19] – ProviderList Refactoring to Sanity CMS
Goal: Migrate ProviderList component from static JSON data to dynamic Sanity CMS data

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated TypeScript Definitions (`src/types/sanity.ts`)**:
   - Added `ProviderProductBlock` interface with fields: id, providerName, productName, logoUrl, displayPrice_kWh, displayMonthlyFee, signupLink, isVindstoedProduct, benefits[]
   - Added `ProviderListBlock` interface for the content block with _type: 'providerList'
   - Added `ProviderListBlock` to the main `ContentBlock` union type

2. **Refactored ProviderList Component (`src/components/ProviderList.tsx`)**:
   - Removed `useProducts` hook dependency and static JSON data fetching
   - Changed component to accept `ProviderListBlock` as props instead of fetching data internally
   - Added data conversion layer `convertToElectricityProduct()` to map Sanity data structure to existing `ElectricityProduct` interface
   - Maintained existing UI functionality: household type selector, consumption slider, sorting logic
   - Preserved sorting logic to prioritize Vindstød products first
   - Added proper error handling for empty provider lists

3. **Updated ContentBlocks Renderer (`src/components/ContentBlocks.tsx`)**:
   - Added import for `ProviderListBlock` type and `ProviderList` component
   - Added new case for `'providerList'` block type in the renderer switch statement
   - Properly typed the block passing to ProviderList component

### Architecture Impact:
- **Data Flow**: Changed from Client-side JSON fetch → Direct Sanity CMS data via props
- **Flexibility**: Now supports dynamic provider management through Sanity Studio
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintained existing ProviderCard interface through data conversion layer
- **Performance**: Eliminated redundant API calls by receiving pre-fetched data as props

### Benefits Mapping Strategy:
The component intelligently maps the flexible `benefits` array from Sanity to existing boolean properties:
- `isVariablePrice`: Searches for benefit text containing "variabel"
- `hasNoBinding`: Searches for benefit text containing "binding" 
- `hasFreeSignup`: Searches for benefit text containing "gratis"

### Next Steps:
- Create corresponding Sanity schema for `providerList` and `providerProduct` document types
- Update Sanity Studio configuration to enable provider management
- Test the new component with sample Sanity data
- Consider migrating the existing JSON data to Sanity initial content

### Notes:
- Component maintains full backward compatibility with existing ProviderCard component
- All existing UI interactions (sliders, selectors, calculations) preserved
- Proper error handling and empty state management implemented
- TypeScript strictly typed throughout the refactoring

## [2024-12-19] – Safety Check Enhancement for ProviderList
Goal: Add robust error handling to prevent "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors

### Changes Made:

1. **Enhanced Safety Check in ProviderList Component (`src/components/ProviderList.tsx`)**:
   - Added explicit `if (!block)` check at the very beginning of the component function
   - Returns clear error message instead of allowing the app to crash
   - Added console.error logging for debugging undefined block props
   - Prevents white screen/crash when block data is missing

2. **Verified ContentBlocks Implementation**:
   - Confirmed that `ContentBlocks.tsx` correctly passes the `block` prop: `<ProviderList key={block._key} block={block as ProviderListBlock} />`
   - Proper TypeScript casting and prop passing already in place
   - Console logging already implemented for debugging

### Architecture Impact:
- **Error Resilience**: App now gracefully handles missing block data without crashing
- **Developer Experience**: Clear error messages and console logging for debugging
- **User Experience**: Shows informative error message instead of white screen

### Error Handling Strategy:
```tsx
if (!block) {
  console.error('ProviderList: block prop is undefined');
  return <div className="text-center text-red-500 py-8">Provider list data is missing.</div>;
}
```

This prevents the runtime error "Cannot read properties of undefined" and provides a clear fallback UI.

## [2024-12-19] – Fix GROQ Query for ProviderList Reference Resolution
Goal: Fix data fetching issue by ensuring GROQ query correctly resolves provider references

### Changes Made:

1. **Fixed Missing ProviderList in GROQ Query (`src/services/sanityService.ts`)**:
   - **Root Cause**: The `providerList` block type was completely missing from the `contentBlocks` expansion in the GROQ query
   - **Added Complete Block Definition**:
     ```groq
     _type == "providerList" => {
       _key,
       _type,
       title,
       'providers': providers[]->{ // Critical: using -> operator to follow references
         "id": _id,
         providerName,
         productName,
         "logoUrl": logo.asset->url,
         displayPrice_kWh,
         displayMonthlyFee,
         signupLink,
         isVindstoedProduct,
         benefits
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Added Debug Logging (`src/components/ProviderList.tsx`)**:
   - Added `console.log('Data received by ProviderList:', JSON.stringify(block, null, 2));`
   - This will help verify if the GROQ query is now correctly fetching provider data
   - Can identify if the issue is data fetching vs. component rendering

### Technical Details:

**Critical GROQ Syntax Elements**:
- `'providers': providers[]->` - The `->` operator is essential for following references to provider documents
- `"logoUrl": logo.asset->url` - Resolves image asset references to actual URLs
- `"id": _id` - Maps Sanity's internal `_id` to our expected `id` field

### Expected Debug Output:
- **If Successful**: Console will show full provider data with resolved references
- **If providers: null or []**: References are not linked correctly in Sanity Studio
- **If data is present but UI broken**: Issue is in React component logic

### Data Flow Impact:
**Before**: GROQ query ignored `providerList` blocks → undefined data → component crashes
**After**: GROQ query properly expands `providerList` → resolved provider references → working component

This fix addresses the root cause of the data fetching issue and should restore full functionality to the ProviderList component.

## [2024-12-19] – TypeScript Centralization Fix
Goal: Fix TypeScript errors by centralizing type definitions for monthlyProductionChart block

- Renamed `MonthlyProductionChart` to `MonthlyProductionChartBlock` for consistency in src/types/sanity.ts
- Created centralized `ContentBlock` union type including all block types
- Simplified `HomePage.contentBlocks` to use `ContentBlock[]` array
