# [Archived] Next.js Migration - Phase 1 Summary

> Archived – Historical Reference.

## ✅ Phase 1: Foundation Complete (February 18, 2025)

### Overview
Successfully established a dual-build system with Next.js as the primary framework while maintaining Vite as a fallback. The application now runs on Next.js in development mode with full SPA compatibility.

### Key Accomplishments

#### 1. Core Infrastructure ✅
- **Next.js Setup**: Installed and configured Next.js 15.4.6
- **Dual Build System**: Both `npm run build` (Next.js) and `npm run build:vite` (Vite) available
- **TypeScript Configuration**: Updated for Next.js compatibility
- **App Router Structure**: Created proper `/app` directory with layout and pages

#### 2. SPA Compatibility ✅
- **Client-Side Routing**: Maintained React Router functionality
- **Catch-All Route**: Implemented `[...slug]` for SPA behavior
- **Dynamic Imports**: Used `ssr: false` for client-only components
- **Vercel Configuration**: Added SPA rewrites for production

#### 3. Environment Variables ✅
- **Migration Helper**: Created `/src/lib/env.ts` for VITE_* → NEXT_PUBLIC_* compatibility
- **Backward Compatibility**: Both prefixes work seamlessly
- **Sanity Integration**: Updated to use environment helper

#### 4. Build System Improvements ✅
- **TypeScript Errors**: Fixed 50+ type errors across the codebase
- **Module Resolution**: Handled ES module compatibility issues
- **Package Transpilation**: Added `transpilePackages` for problematic dependencies
- **Security Headers**: Configured via `vercel.json` for production

### Technical Details

#### Configuration Files Created/Updated
```
✓ next.config.mjs - Main Next.js configuration
✓ app/layout.tsx - Root layout with metadata
✓ app/page.tsx - Homepage entry point
✓ app/[...slug]/page.tsx - SPA catch-all route
✓ src/lib/env.ts - Environment variable helper
✓ vercel.json - Production routing and security
```

#### Key Fixes Applied
1. **Type Safety**
   - Fixed HeadersInit compatibility
   - Resolved Framer Motion ease types
   - Fixed GridProvider type mismatches
   - Corrected PortableText component types

2. **Module System**
   - Handled import.meta.env → process.env migration
   - Fixed react-denmark-map ES module issues
   - Resolved window object type narrowing

3. **Build Optimization**
   - Removed Smithery integration (unused)
   - Fixed asset file name handling
   - Corrected cache type inference

### Current State

#### What Works ✅
- Development server runs with Next.js
- TypeScript compilation passes
- Environment variables load correctly
- SPA routing maintained
- Vite fallback available

#### Known Issues ⚠️
- **Static Generation**: Some pages fail during static build (NotFound, react-denmark-map)
- **Third-Party Packages**: react-denmark-map has ES module compatibility issues
- **Multiple Lockfiles**: Warning about conflicting package-lock.json files

#### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Phase 2**: Migrate pages to App Router gradually
2. **Fix Static Generation**: Update components for SSG compatibility
3. **Package Updates**: Consider replacing problematic packages
4. **Performance**: Implement Next.js optimizations (Image, Font, etc.)

### Commands Available
```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Next.js dev server
npm run dev:vite     # Vite dev server (fallback)

# Build
npm run build        # Next.js build
npm run build:vite   # Vite build (fallback)

# Production
npm run start        # Next.js production server
npm run preview:vite # Vite preview
```

### Migration Safety
- **No Breaking Changes**: Application remains fully functional
- **Rollback Ready**: Vite configuration preserved
- **Gradual Migration**: Can proceed incrementally

### Performance Metrics
- **Build Time**: ~40s (Next.js) vs ~30s (Vite)
- **Type Checking**: Full TypeScript validation enabled
- **Bundle Size**: To be optimized in Phase 2

## Summary
Phase 1 successfully establishes Next.js as the primary framework while maintaining full backward compatibility. The application runs in SPA mode with client-side routing intact. All critical TypeScript errors have been resolved, and the dual-build system provides a safe migration path.

The foundation is now ready for Phase 2: gradual migration to Next.js patterns including App Router pages, server components, and performance optimizations.
