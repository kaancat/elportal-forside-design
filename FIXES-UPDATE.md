- Stronger colors: Blue (#3b82f6) for DK1, Purple (#8b5cf6) for DK2
- Added sea background (#e6f3ff) for better contrast
- Shadow effects to make landmasses stand out
- Improved labels with white backgrounds for readability
- Map now clearly shows Denmark's recognizable shape

- Changed wrappers to React Fragments where appropriate
