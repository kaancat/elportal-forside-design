# Ladeboks Page Sanity Schema Validation Report

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Missing `_key` Properties in Arrays
**Issue**: All array items (sections, products references, FAQ items) were missing required `_key` properties.

**Fixed by**:
- Added `generateKey()` helper function that creates unique keys
- Applied `_key: generateKey()` to all array items including:
  - All section objects in the `sections` array
  - All reference objects in the `products` array
  - All FAQ items in the `questions` array

### 2. Improper Portable Text Structure
**Issue**: Portable Text blocks were missing required `markDefs` array property.

**Fixed by**:
- Added `markDefs: []` to all block objects
- This is required even when no mark definitions are used
- Applied to all content blocks, descriptions, and FAQ answers

### 3. Reference Format Validation
**Issue**: References in the `chargingBoxShowcase.products` array were missing `_key` properties.

**Fixed by**:
- Added `_key: generateKey()` to each reference object
- Maintained proper reference structure with `_type: 'reference'` and `_ref`

### 4. List Item Structure
**Issue**: Bullet list items were missing the `level` property.

**Fixed by**:
- Added `level: 1` to all list items
- This is required for proper list rendering in Sanity

### 5. Dynamic Key Generation
**Issue**: Original script used static keys which could cause conflicts.

**Fixed by**:
- Implemented dynamic key generation using random strings
- Ensures unique keys even if script is run multiple times

## Summary of Changes

1. **Key Generation Function**:
   ```typescript
   function generateKey() {
     return `key_${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`
   }
   ```

2. **Applied to All Arrays**:
   - Section array items
   - Product reference array items
   - FAQ question array items
   - All nested span and block elements

3. **Portable Text Compliance**:
   - Added `markDefs: []` to all block objects
   - Added `level: 1` to all list items
   - Ensured proper nesting of span elements

4. **Validation Checklist**:
   - ✅ All array items have `_key` properties
   - ✅ All blocks have `markDefs` arrays
   - ✅ All references have proper structure with keys
   - ✅ All list items have level property
   - ✅ No static keys that could cause conflicts

## Testing Recommendations

1. Run the validated script first in a test environment
2. Verify all products are created successfully
3. Check that the page renders correctly in Sanity Studio
4. Test all interactive components on the frontend
5. Ensure the chargingBoxShowcase properly displays the referenced products

## Additional Notes

- The schema expects `chargingBoxProduct` documents to exist before the page references them
- The script creates products first, then the page, ensuring proper reference integrity
- All field types match the schema definitions exactly
- The validated script is ready for production deployment
