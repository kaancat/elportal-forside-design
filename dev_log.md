Goal: Create RealPriceComparisonTable component for live electricity supplier price comparison

- Created new React component `src/components/RealPriceComparisonTable.tsx`
- Created new API route `api/pricelists.ts` to fetch data from EnergiDataService Datahub Price List
- Component features interactive supplier selection using Select dropdowns
- Added consumption slider for dynamic price calculations
- Implemented responsive table design with TailwindCSS styling
- Fixed TypeScript linting errors by properly typing API responses
- Component fetches live data from EnergiDataService.dk API
