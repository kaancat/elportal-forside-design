# Charging Box Setup Verification Report

## Summary
The charging box products and Ladeboks page setup has been partially implemented but requires attention to complete the configuration.

## Current Status

### ✅ What's Working
1. **Charging Box Products Created**: Three charging box products exist in Sanity:
   - `chargingBoxProduct-defa-power`
   - `chargingBoxProduct-easee-up`
   - `chargingBoxProduct-zaptec-go`

2. **Products Have Basic Structure**:
   - Each product has 5 features defined
   - Each product has a description
   - The schema structure is in place

### ❌ What Needs Fixing

1. **Missing Product Data**: All three products are missing critical fields:
   - **title**: Not set (required for display)
   - **brand**: Not set (e.g., "DEFA", "Easee", "Zaptec")
   - **model**: Not set (e.g., "Power", "UP", "Go")
   - **price**: Not set (required for comparison)
   - **monthlyPrice**: Not set
   - **powerRating**: Not set
   - **chargingSpeed**: Not set
   - **image**: No images uploaded
   - **specifications**: Not defined
   - **pros/cons**: Not defined
   - **bestFor**: Not defined

2. **Ladeboks Page Not Found**: The page at `page.ladeboks` doesn't exist in Sanity

3. **No Charging Box Comparison Blocks**: No pages currently use the `chargingBoxComparison` content block

## ID Mismatch Issue
The products were created with hyphenated IDs (e.g., `chargingBoxProduct-defa-power`) instead of dot-notation IDs (e.g., `chargingBoxProduct.defa-power`). This is actually the correct format for Sanity document IDs.

## Action Items

### 1. Complete Product Data in Sanity Studio
For each charging box product, add:
- Title (e.g., "DEFA Power Ladeboks")
- Brand and Model
- Pricing information
- Technical specifications
- Product images
- Pros and cons lists

### 2. Create or Update Ladeboks Page
The Ladeboks page needs to be created with:
- Proper slug: "ladeboks"
- Hero section
- ChargingBoxComparison block referencing the three products
- Supporting content blocks

### 3. Update Product References
When creating the Ladeboks page, use the correct product IDs:
```javascript
products: [
  { _ref: 'chargingBoxProduct-defa-power', _type: 'reference' },
  { _ref: 'chargingBoxProduct-easee-up', _type: 'reference' },
  { _ref: 'chargingBoxProduct-zaptec-go', _type: 'reference' }
]
```

## Verification Commands

To check the current status:
```bash
# Check product details
npx tsx scripts/check-charging-box-details.ts

# Run full verification
npx tsx scripts/verify-charging-box-setup.ts
```

## Next Steps
1. Log into Sanity Studio at https://dinelportal.sanity.studio
2. Navigate to Charging Box Products
3. Complete all missing fields for each product
4. Create the Ladeboks page with appropriate content blocks
5. Test the page at https://dinelportal.dk/ladeboks

## Technical Notes
- The charging box products use the correct Sanity ID format with hyphens
- The frontend ChargingBoxComparison component expects these exact field names
- Product images should be high-quality product photos
- Prices should be in DKK without VAT (VAT will be added in display)
