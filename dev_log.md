## [2024-12-28] – Session Start
Goal: Create RealPriceComparisonTable component for live electricity supplier price comparison

- Created new React component `src/components/RealPriceComparisonTable.tsx`
- Created new API route `api/pricelists.ts` to fetch data from EnergiDataService Datahub Price List
- Component features interactive supplier selection using Select dropdowns
- Added consumption slider for dynamic price calculations
- Implemented responsive table design with TailwindCSS styling
- Fixed TypeScript linting errors by properly typing API responses
- Component fetches live data from EnergiDataService.dk API
- Filters for consumer products (marked with 'Privat') and removes duplicates
- NOTE: Both Select and Slider shadcn/ui components were already available in the project

- Currency formatting utility function
- Clean separation between frontend component and backend API route

## [2024-12-28] – Content Block Renderer Integration
Goal: Integrate RealPriceComparisonTable into the content block rendering system

- Updated `src/types/sanity.ts` to add `RealPriceComparisonTable` interface
- Updated `ContentBlocks.tsx` to import and handle `realPriceComparisonTable` block type
- Added new case in the block renderer switch statement
- Fixed TypeScript linting errors with proper type definitions
- Added proper logging for debugging block processing
- Component is now ready to render when Sanity provides `realPriceComparisonTable` blocks

NOTE: Frontend will now recognize and render the price comparison component when it receives blocks of type `realPriceComparisonTable` from Sanity CMS
