## [2024-12-28] – Renewable Energy Chart Visual Bug Fixes
Goal: Fix visual bugs in the stacked area chart for proper rendering of zero-value categories

- Fixed `processedData` useMemo hook to ensure all 24 hours are present in the dataset
- Added full 24-hour array generation (`00:00` to `23:00`) for complete time coverage
- Improved data processing to handle missing hours from API response
- Added `stackId="1"` to all Area components to ensure proper stacking behavior
- Ensures zero-value categories are properly displayed in the stacked areas
- Fixed issue where Recharts might optimize away zero-value areas
- Enhanced robustness against incomplete API data responses

## Bug Fixes Applied
- **Complete Hour Coverage**: Generates full 24-hour dataset even if API returns incomplete data
- **Proper Stacking**: Added stackId to ensure all Area components stack correctly
- **Zero-Value Handling**: Ensures zero-value energy sources are still visible in the chart
- **Data Consistency**: Guarantees consistent chart rendering regardless of API data gaps
- **Visual Continuity**: Maintains proper color stacking and area rendering

NOTE: The renewable energy forecast chart should now properly display all energy categories with correct stacking behavior

## [2024-12-28] – RenewableEnergyForecast Data Processing Logic Fixes  
Goal: Fix data processing logic to correctly parse API data and render the chart with proper scaling

- **Replaced processedData useMemo hook**: Simplified and corrected the data grouping logic
  - Removed complex 24-hour array generation that was causing issues
  - Implemented direct hour-based grouping using `toLocaleTimeString` with both hour and minute
  - Fixed hour key formatting to use proper `HH:mm` format with colon replacement
  - Added proper null/empty data checks at the beginning of the function
  - Simplified return mapping using object destructuring for cleaner code

- **Enhanced Y-Axis scaling**: Added `domain={[0, 'dataMax + 100']}` prop to YAxis component
  - Prevents "flatline" effect when values are very low but not zero
  - Ensures Y-axis scales nicely from 0 to slightly above the highest data value
  - Improves chart readability by providing proper visual scale

## Technical Improvements
- **Simplified Logic**: More direct and reliable data processing approach  
- **Better Hour Handling**: Proper time formatting using Danish locale settings
- **Robust Grouping**: For-loop based iteration with proper type safety
- **Enhanced Scaling**: Dynamic Y-axis domain prevents visual scaling issues
- **Improved Reliability**: Better handling of edge cases and empty data scenarios

NOTE: The chart should now correctly parse API data and render with proper visual scaling, resolving any rendering issues with the renewable energy forecast display

## [2024-12-28] – Area Chart Stacking Order Fix
Goal: Fix visual stacking order in RenewableEnergyForecast to ensure all energy types are properly visible

- **Fixed Area Component Order**: Reversed the order of the three `<Area>` components in the AreaChart
  - **New Order**: OffshoreWind → OnshoreWind → Solar (was Solar → OnshoreWind → OffshoreWind)
  - **Reasoning**: In stacked area charts, components rendered later appear on top, potentially hiding earlier ones
  - **Visual Impact**: All three energy types (Solar, Onshore Wind, Offshore Wind) are now properly visible
  - **Color Layering**: Ensures proper color composition reflects true renewable energy forecast data

## Technical Implementation
- **Stacking Logic**: Recharts renders Area components in the order they appear in JSX
- **Visibility Fix**: By placing wind components first and Solar last, all layers are now visible
- **Data Integrity**: Chart now accurately represents the composition of renewable energy sources
- **User Experience**: Users can clearly see the contribution of each energy type at any given hour

NOTE: The renewable energy forecast chart now displays all three energy categories with proper visual stacking, ensuring complete data visibility and accurate representation of the energy mix

## [2024-12-28] – API Property Name Alignment
Goal: Correct property names in RenewableEnergyForecast to match actual EnergiDataService API data structure

- **Updated TypeScript Interfaces**: Fixed ForecastRecord and ProcessedData interfaces to use API's actual property names
  - **ForecastType**: Changed from `'OnshoreWind' | 'OffshoreWind'` to `'Onshore Wind' | 'Offshore Wind'` (with spaces)
  - **ProcessedData**: Updated property names to use quoted strings for properties with spaces
  - **API Alignment**: Now matches the actual data structure from EnergiDataService API

- **Corrected Data Processing Logic**: Updated `processedData` useMemo hook in three key areas:
  - **Type Definition**: `groupedByHour` object now uses `'Onshore Wind'` and `'Offshore Wind'` with quotes
  - **Initialization**: Updated object initialization to use proper property names with spaces
  - **Explicit Mapping**: Replaced object spread with explicit property mapping to handle spaced property names correctly

- **Fixed Area Component DataKeys**: Updated `<Area>` components to use correct property names
  - **Offshore Wind**: `dataKey="OffshoreWind"` → `dataKey="Offshore Wind"`
  - **Onshore Wind**: `dataKey="OnshoreWind"` → `dataKey="Onshore Wind"`
  - **Solar**: Remains `dataKey="Solar"` (no change needed)

## Technical Implementation Details
- **Property Name Handling**: Used bracket notation `values['Onshore Wind']` for properties with spaces
- **TypeScript Compatibility**: Quoted property names in interfaces to handle spaces correctly
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures perfect alignment between component and API data structure
- **Chart Rendering**: Area components now correctly reference the processed data properties

NOTE: The renewable energy forecast component now perfectly aligns with EnergiDataService API data structure, ensuring proper data mapping and chart rendering with the correct property names that include spaces

NOTE: The renewable energy forecast chart now displays all three energy categories with proper visual stacking, ensuring complete data visibility and accurate representation of the energy mix

## [2024-12-28] – Energy Forecast API "Danmark" View Support
Goal: Enhance energy-forecast API route to support a unified "Danmark" view alongside regional DK1/DK2 views

- **Updated API Logic**: Modified `api/energy-forecast.ts` to conditionally apply region filtering
  - **Default Region**: Changed from `'DK1'` to `'Danmark'` as the default parameter
  - **Conditional Filtering**: Implemented logic to check if region is "Danmark" 
  - **Region Filter Logic**: When region is "Danmark", no PriceArea filter is applied (shows all Denmark data)
  - **Regional Views**: When region is "DK1" or "DK2", applies specific PriceArea filter

- **Enhanced API Flexibility**: Now supports three view modes:
  - **Danmark**: Returns all renewable energy forecast data for entire Denmark (no regional filtering)
  - **DK1 (Vestdanmark)**: Returns data filtered specifically for West Denmark price area
  - **DK2 (Østdanmark)**: Returns data filtered specifically for East Denmark price area

## Technical Implementation Details
- **Conditional URL Building**: Uses template string with conditional `regionFilter` variable
- **API URL Structure**: Maintains same EnergiDataService endpoint with dynamic filtering
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing DK1/DK2 functionality remains unchanged
- **Error Handling**: Preserved existing error handling and status codes

## Usage Examples
- **All Denmark**: `/api/energy-forecast?region=Danmark&date=2024-12-28`
- **West Denmark**: `/api/energy-forecast?region=DK1&date=2024-12-28`  
- **East Denmark**: `/api/energy-forecast?region=DK2&date=2024-12-28`

NOTE: The energy forecast API now provides flexible viewing options, allowing users to see either unified Denmark data or specific regional breakdowns for more detailed analysis

- **Updated Component Structure**:
  - **Props Interface**: Added optional `explanation` field for Sanity rich text content
  - **State Management**: Updated `currentRegion` type to include 'Danmark', default changed to 'Danmark'
  - **TooltipProvider**: Wrapped entire component for proper tooltip functionality
  - **Sanity Integration**: Added PortableText rendering for rich explanation content
