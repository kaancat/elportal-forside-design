# Energibesparende Tips Page Merge - Summary

## Issue
Two duplicate pages were created with the same slug `energibesparende-tips`:
1. **Document 1** (ID: `qgCxJyBbKpvhb2oGYpYKuf`) - Created with random ID, had validation error
2. **Document 2** (ID: `page.energibesparende-tips`) - More content, but custom ID breaks navigation

## Root Cause
- Two different deployment scripts were used
- `deploy-energibesparende-tips.ts` used `client.create()` → random ID
- `create-energibesparende-tips-page.ts` used `client.createOrReplace()` with custom ID `page.energibesparende-tips`
- Custom IDs with dots break Sanity navigation references (as documented in SANITY_PAGE_CREATION_GUIDELINES.md)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Analyzed Both Documents
- Document 1: 16 blocks, ~801 words, had priceCalculatorWidget (causing validation error)
- Document 2: 14 blocks, ~1016 words, more comprehensive content

### 2. Created Merged Page
- Took all content from Document 2 (preferred version)
- Added unique valuable blocks from Document 1:
  - renewableEnergyForecast
  - co2EmissionsChart
  - valueProposition
- Skipped priceCalculatorWidget (validation error)
- Created new page with Sanity-generated ID: `I7aq0qw44tdJ3YglBpsP1G`

### 3. Updated Navigation
- Found and updated references in siteSettings
- Changed from old IDs to new merged page ID

### 4. Deleted Old Pages
- Successfully deleted both problematic documents
- Cleaned up temporary reference files

### 5. Fixed Validation Issues
- Fixed missing fields in callToActionSection
- Corrected validation script (applianceCalculator doesn't need 'appliances' field)

## Final Result
✅ Single page with ID: `I7aq0qw44tdJ3YglBpsP1G`
✅ Contains all content from Document 2 + valuable blocks from Document 1
✅ No validation errors
✅ Proper Sanity-generated ID (no navigation issues)
✅ 17 content blocks total

## Lessons Learned
1. **Never use custom IDs** for content pages (especially with dots)
2. **Always use `client.create()`** for new pages (not `createOrReplace`)
3. **Single deployment script** prevents duplicates
4. **Validate immediately** after page creation
