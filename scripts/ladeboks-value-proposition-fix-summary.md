# Ladeboks Page Value Proposition Fix Summary

## Issue
The Value Proposition Box on the ladeboks page was showing content on the frontend but appeared empty in Sanity Studio. This was due to the data being stored in deprecated fields.

## Root Cause
1. The valueProposition schema has deprecated fields (`title`, `items`) that were being used instead of the current fields (`heading`, `valueItems`)
2. The frontend component was checking for both old and new fields, masking the issue
3. The GROQ query was only fetching the deprecated fields

## Changes Made

### 1. Data Migration (Sanity)
- Migrated data from deprecated `items` field to the correct `valueItems` field
- Migrated `title` to `heading` field
- Preserved all icons, headings, and descriptions exactly as they were

### 2. Frontend Updates
- Updated `ValuePropositionComponent.tsx` to prioritize new fields while maintaining backward compatibility
- Added support for `subheading` field
- Updated field priority: `valueItems` > `items` > `propositions`

### 3. GROQ Query Updates
- Updated `sanityService.ts` to fetch both new and legacy fields
- Ensures backward compatibility while supporting the new structure

## Data Successfully Migrated

The Value Proposition now contains:
- **Heading**: "Fordele ved hjemmeopladning"
- **4 Value Items**:
  1. "Altid en fuld 'tank' om morgenen"
  2. "Markant billigere opladning"
  3. "Sikker og certificeret opladning"
  4. "Øger værdien af din bolig"

All items retain their original icons and descriptions.

## Verification
- ✅ Data now visible in Sanity Studio under correct fields
- ✅ Frontend continues to display content correctly
- ✅ All icons preserved with proper `icon.manager` format
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

## Scripts Created
1. `fix-ladeboks-value-proposition.ts` - Migrates data from old to new fields
2. `verify-ladeboks-value-proposition.ts` - Verifies the migration and checks data integrity

## Next Steps
- The data is now properly structured in Sanity
- No further action required
- The page should continue to work correctly on both frontend and in Sanity Studio
