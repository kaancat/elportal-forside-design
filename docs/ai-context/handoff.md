## Architecture & Design Decisions

### Recent Decisions

## Design Decisions Made
- **Decision**: Two-project architecture with direct API integration
  - Date: Updated after practical experience
  - Rationale: Direct Sanity API approach proved more efficient than separate SEO builder
  - Alternatives considered: Three-project with NDJSON export (original), Monorepo
  - Impact: Simplified architecture, faster content generation
  - Validation: Successfully created multiple SEO pages with direct API

- **Decision**: Vercel serverless for API proxy
  - Date: Frontend implementation
  - Rationale: Avoid CORS, hide complexity, enable caching
  - Alternatives considered: Direct API calls, dedicated backend
  - Impact: Simplified frontend, better security
  - Validation: Working well with current traffic

- **Decision**: NDJSON for content import
  - Date: SEO Builder design
  - Rationale: Sanity's native import format
  - Alternatives considered: Direct API, CSV
  - Impact: Reliable bulk imports
  - Validation: Successfully importing complex content

### Technical Debt & Issues

## Technical Debt Identified
- **Issue**: TypeScript strict mode disabled
  - Location: tsconfig.json
  - Impact: Potential runtime errors not caught
  - Proposed solution: Gradual migration file by file
  - Priority: High - affects code quality

- **Issue**: No shared types package
  - Location: All three projects
  - Impact: Duplicate type definitions
  - Proposed solution: Create @dinelportal/types package
  - Priority: High - affects maintainability

- **Issue**: Direct Sanity queries in components
  - Location: Frontend components
  - Impact: No caching, potential performance issues
  - Proposed solution: Implement React Query
  - Priority: Medium - affects performance

## Next Session Goals

### Immediate Priorities

## Next Session Priorities
1. **Primary Goal**: Implement TypeScript strict mode
   - Success criteria: All files pass strict type checking
   - Prerequisites: Type analysis documentation

2. **Secondary Goal**: Create shared types package
   - Dependencies: Complete type inventory
   - Resources needed: npm organization setup

3. **If Time Permits**: Add React Query integration
   - Context: Would improve data fetching performance
   - Preparation: Review React Query documentation

### Knowledge Gaps

## Knowledge Gaps to Address
