# Denmark Map Fix - Using react-denmark-map

## What Was Fixed

### Previous Issues:
- Hand-drawn SVG map that didn't accurately represent Denmark
- Cluttered legend box in upper left corner
- Overly complex with too many details
- Getting worse with each iteration

### Solution Implemented:
1. **Used react-denmark-map library** (already installed in project)
   - Professional, accurate map of Denmark with all municipalities
   - Clean and recognizable shape

2. **Simple coloring system**:
   - DK1 (West Denmark) - Blue (#60a5fa)
   - DK2 (East Denmark) - Purple (#a78bfa)
   - Municipalities automatically colored based on their region

3. **Clean design**:
   - Removed the legend box from upper left corner
   - Added simple region labels (DK1/DK2) as overlay
   - Small legend at bottom showing color meanings
   - Kept existing description text

4. **Created utility file** `/src/utils/denmarkRegions.ts`:
   - Lists all municipalities by region
   - Function to determine which region a municipality belongs to

## Result
- Clean, professional map that accurately shows Denmark
- Clear visual distinction between DK1 and DK2 regions
- No unnecessary clutter or complex details
- Uses the same mapping library as ConsumptionMap for consistency
